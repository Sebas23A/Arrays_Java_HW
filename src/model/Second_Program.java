		 * IF this code didn't have any errors, then the output would be 2. 
		 * 
		 * The error comes from having a different variable name for the array on two lines of code
		 * that intend to call the same array. exampleArray[], differs from example*S*Array[].
		 * ----------- SO, the code would error out because of this --------------------
		 * If that error got corrected, then it would error out for the FOR loop syntax. 
		 * On the conditional for number of repetitions "i<exampleArray>" the last angle bracket 
		 * is considered an error since it's not supposed to be there. so that would be another error.
		 * 
		 * If these two would get correted then the output would be 2 because the variable "i" iterates
		 * twice until the index of the Array hits 2 (which belongs to the value 6). This will force the
		 * conditional inside the IF statement to fail after the maximum value has been assigned to 6. 
		 * 
		 * Always good to keep in mind that the index of the element that corresponds to 6 on the array,
		 * is 2, thus why the "index" gets that last value of 2 (which is what the program is printing.
